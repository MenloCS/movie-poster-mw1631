# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- **Movie Title: The Last Song**  
- **Why I chose this movie: Because it's my favorite movie.**  

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion:Love and family**  

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element: Ronnie and Will must appear also Ronnie's family must appear somewhere as well.**  
- **Why this element:Because they are the main characters of the story.**  

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid:Harsh dark colors.**  

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s):Yellows, pinks, golds, peaches.**  
- **Accent color(s):light blue, and light lavender.**  
- **Overall mood:warm** (warm/cool/muted/vibrant/dark/bright)  

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)  
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  
- [ ] Medium shot (full figure)  
- [ ] Object/symbol centered  
- [x] Character collage  

- **Focal point description: I want them to be on a beach and like it's the two of them in the center and the family on the side.**

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt: I  want a movie poster (with no title) of a couple who happens to be Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth on the beach playing piano together there should be a beach house in the background**  

- **What worked: The piano and the beach house**  
- **What didn't work: the father and son hugging each other**  
- **What I'll change for next attempt: to no longer have the father and son hugging each other in the background.**  

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt:I  want a movie poster (with no title) of a couple who happens to be Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth on the beach playing piano together there should be a beach house in the background there should be no father and son hugging each other in the background and they should be wearing shorts and a t-shirt or tank top**  

- **What worked:The piano and the beach house**  
- **What didn't work:the guy should not be playing the piano**  
- **What I'll change for next attempt:I will have the girl play piano**

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt:**  

- **What worked:**  
- **What didn't work:**  
- **What I'll change for next attempt:**  

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt:**  

- **What worked:**  
- **What didn't work:**  

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?)

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  
2.  
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  


**What would you do differently next time?**
